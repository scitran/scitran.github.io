          <h3 id="instrument">Instrument <a href="#SDM">&#8613;</a></h3>
            <p>The instrument (in this diagram represented by an MRI scanner) trasmits data directly and securely into the SDM pipeline via the Reaper. The trasfer takes place through a private network connection. Other instruments, which output a standardized file type (e.g., DICOM) can be used as the source for data coming into the pipeline. </p>

          <h3 id="reaper">Reaper <a href="#SDM">&#8613;</a></h3>
            <p>Reaper is the point of contact between the Instrument and the SDM pipeline. Reaper is engineered in Python and talks directly with the instrument, from which it 'reaps' every data file that is captured by the instrument (e.g., every DICOM file) for sorting and processing into the SDM database. Reaper communicates with the rest of the SDM pipeline via the RESTful API. </p>

            <p>Importantly, Reaper allows data to enter the SDM framework without any user interaction whatsoever. If a scan is performed on an intrument the raw data will be captured and sorted into the database, period. This removes worries about user compliance and shifts the burden of capture and archiving from the user to the software.</p>

            <p>SDM servers run <a href="http://open-zfs.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">OpenZFS</a> for raw data storage and backup. ZFS is a combined file system and logical volume manager which provides protection against data corruption, support for high storage capacities, efficient data compression, integration of the concepts of filesystem and volume management, snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity checking and automatic repair, RAID-Z and native NFSv4 ACLs <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zfs" target="_blank">ref</a></sup>.</p>

          <h3 id="restful_api">RESTful API <a href="#SDM">&#8613;</a></h3>
            <p>Once Reaper has sent the data thorugh the API those data are sorted (using metadata) into the database. SDM uses <a href="http://mongodb.org" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> - which is a no-SQL, cross-platform, document-oriented database. MongoDB allows the SDM database to be incredibly flexible by virtue of its dynamic schemas.</p>

            <p>The SDM API (Application Programming Interface) has been engineered to adhere to the tenets of the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) framework and architectural style. The RESTful architectural style "ignores the details of component implementation and protocol syntax in order to focus on the roles of components, the constraints upon their interaction with other components, and their interpretation of significant data elements" <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">ref</a></sup>. </p>

          <h3 id="automated_processor">Automated Processor <a href="#SDM">&#8613;</a></h3>
            <p>Once raw data are reaped and sorted into the database they are automatically processed using tools engineered in Python, using various open-source libraries (e.g., <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pydicom/" target="_blank"> pydicom</a>, <a href="http://nipy.org/nibabel/" target="_blank">NiBabel</a>, <a href="http://dcmstack.readthedocs.org/en/v0.6.1/" target="_blank">DcmStack</a>, etc.) . </p>

          <h3 id="SDMdata">SDMdata <a href="#SDM">&#8613;</a></h3>
            <p><a href="http://scitran.github.io/SDMdata">SDMdata</a>, our custom-engineered, open-source library, takes raw data and performs various processing tasks. For example, raw DICOM data from GE or Siemens scanners are converted to a widely used, compressed, file format -- NIfTI. Quality Assurance metrics are also automatically computed and made available alongside raw data. We have also built upon visualization toolkits to make viewing data within the SDM UI as simple as clicking a button.</p>

            <p>SDMdata is engineered to be modular -- researchers can design their own purpose-built computational modules that can plug-in to SDMdata and perform special processing operations.</p>

            <p>For more detailed information, have a look at the SDMdata <a href="http://scitran.github.io/NIMSdata">documentation.</a></p>

          <h3 id="data_management">Data Management <a href="#SDM">&#8613;</a></h3>
            <p>Data management as well as user rights and permissions are all handled through a custom-engineered Web UI - built with HTML5 and AngularJS. The SDM UI allows users to access their data from anywhere in the world and provides the interface through which they can browse, organize, download, search and share their data.</p>

            <p>Users may also search for and request access to data at remote sites. Users can even create Virtual Projects, consisting of data across projects, labs, and even instuttions. Sharing and permissions are managed within the SDM UI. Acess to the SDM UI is managed via <a href="http://oauth.net" target="_blank">OAuth</a>.</p>

          <h3 id="user">User <a href="#SDM">&#8613;</a></h3>
            <p>SDM is user focused. At each stage of development our team was completely focused on what was important for everyday users. We wanted to develop a system that was as simple and easy to use as possible. </p>

            <p>That's why we developed REAPER, which direcly communicates with the Instrument, relieving the burdon normally befalling the user to actually get their data into the system. By making that step automatic users can rest assured that every byte the instrument produces gets into the system. </p>

            <p>We also developed our Automatic Processing pipeline with the user in mind. A very well known issue in neuroimaging is conversion of raw data to a standardized file format, adhering to accepted conventions. We take this step for the user and convert GE and Siemens raw DICOM files to NIfTI. Those NIfTI files are then stored in the database and appear alongside the raw data, allowing the user to download raw data, NIfTI data, or both. Not only does this make sure that file formats and conventions are consistently correct, but alleviates the computational and organizational burdon that users typically face. </p>

            <p>Nowhere is our user-focused approach more evident than in the UI design of the SDM front-end web application. The SDM UI is the only point of contact to the entire system for most users. The prime objective of our UI development team is making a simple, yet incredibly powerful, interface that makes data management easy.</p>

          <h3 id="inter_SDM">SciTran Central <a href="#SDM">&#8613;</a></h3>
            <p>InterSDM makes it possible for peer-discovery, cross-site database queries, and data sharing. While running, a SDM site will brodcast its existence to InterSDM, which will securely provide across-site access to resources.</p>

          <h3 id="remote_site">Remote Sites <a href="#SDM">&#8613;</a></h3>
            <p>Remote sites running their own instance of SDM can communicate with one another securely (via InterSDM) allowing for researchers from any one site to search and share data with those at other sites around the world.</p>
