# Our Mission

#### save science...
{: .text-black}

The mission of SciTran echos that of the Project on Scientific Transparency (PoST) - to transform the way neuroscientists approach the analysis of human neuroimaging data. We hope that the tools and environment we are working to create will help to change the culture of human neuroimaging research, speed scientific progress, and create new opportunities for collaboration.
