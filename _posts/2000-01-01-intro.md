# Scientific Transparency

### Saving Science -- Starting with Neuroscience
{: .text-orange}

Scientific Transparency (SciTran) is a software project that has grown out of the <a href="http://post.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Project on Scientific Transparency</a> at <a href="http://stanford.edu" target="_blank">Stanford University</a>. At the heart of SciTran is a scientific data management system -- SDM -- designed to enable and foster reproducible research.

SciTran SDM delivers efficient and robust archiving, organization, and sharing of scientific data. We have developed the system around neuroimaging data, but our goal is to build a system that is flexible enough to accomodate all types of scientific data -- from paper-and-pencil tests to genomics data. SDM will also allow for the sharing of data and computations between remote sites.

SciTran is open-source software, released under the MIT license. Our <a href="https://github.com/scitran" target="_blank">code</a> is hosted on GitHub. Feel free to try it out or to contribute. Commercial support for SciTran SDM is available through our partners at <a href="http://flywheel.io" target="_blank">Flywheel</a>. Check out their <a href="https://demo.flywheel.io" target="_blank">demo</a>, if you'd like to give SDM a quick try.
