# Scientific Transparency


### Saving science. Starting with neuroscience.
{: .text-blue}



Scientific Transparency (SciTran) is a software project that has grown out of the Project on Scientific Transparency [(PoST)](http://post.stanford.edu). At the heart of SciTran is a scientific data management system -- **SDM** -- designed to support reproducible research.  

The SciTran **SDM** delivers efficient and robust archiving, organization, and sharing of scientific data. We have developed the system around neuroimaging data, but our goal is to develop a system that is flexible enough to accomodate all types of scientific data from paper and pencil tests to genomics data. **SDM** will also allow data and computational sharing between remote sites. 

<!--
The mission of SciTran echos that of the Project on Scientific Transparency (PoST) - to transform the way neuroscientists approach the analysis of human neuroimaging data. 


We hope that the tools and environment we are working to create will help to change the culture of human neuroimaging research, speed scientific progress, and create new opportunities for collaboration.
