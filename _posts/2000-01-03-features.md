# Features


The focus of SciTran is the development of a scientific data management system -- SDM. Below we describe some of the features of SDM that make it different from many other data management solutions available.


<table>
	<tr>

		<td vertical-align="middle"> 
			<strongg>Data Integrity - </strongg> </br>Raw data from the MRI scanner are automatically formatted and stored in SDM - no user action is needed. This ensures data integrity and eliminates the possibility of data loss.
		</td>
		<td width="15%"><img src="img/features/db_mri.png" width="80%"></td>
	</tr>

	<tr> <!-- Archive -->

		<td vertical-align="middle"> 
			<strongg>Archiving - </strongg> </br>Centralized data backup is greatly simplified because all the data are in a single location rather than distributed amongst many sites. Individual labs need not arrange separate backup protocols. This supports data integrity.
		</td>
		<td width="12%"><img src="img/features/db_archive.png" width="80%"></td>
	</tr>

	<tr> <!-- Retrieve -->
		<td vertical-align="middle"> 
			<strongg>Retrieval - </strongg> </br>At the end of a measurement session, users download their data from a web-page. To find your labâ€™s data, simply log in to the SDM database and you will see all data that is open to your lab. 
		</td>
		<td width="12%"><img src="img/features/db_retrieve.png" width="80%"></td>
	</tr>

	<tr> <!-- Organization -->
		<td vertical-align="middle"> 
			<strongg>Organization - </strongg> </br>Files and experiments are stored using a standard naming convention that helps lab members keep track of their experiments.  
		</td>
		<td width="12%"><img src="img/features/db_organize.png" width="80%" ></td>
	</tr>

	<tr> <!-- Uploading -->
		<td vertical-align="middle"> 
			<strongg>Uploading - </strongg> </br>Data can be added to SDM by using a simple web-interface or by placing files in an identified directory. In this way older datasets or datasets collected at another institution can be brought into SDM. 
		</td>
		<td width="12%"><img src="img/features/db_upload.png" width="80%" ></td>
	</tr>

	<tr> <!-- Sharing and Rights Management -->
		<td vertical-align="middle"> 
			<strongg>Sharing and Rights Management - </strongg> </br>By default, only the PI's group has access to the data. Using a simple web-interface, however, the PI can grant access to other individuals or groups. Access can be granted to entire projects or to individual datasets. The PI has the option to make the data publicly available. 
		</td>
		<td width="12%"><img src="img/features/db_sharing.png" width="80%" ></td>
	</tr>
	
	
	<tr> <!-- Search and Discovery -->
		<td vertical-align="middle"> 
			<strongg>Search and Discovery - </strongg> </br>The SDM database can be searched in many ways, such as by investigator, subject type, data type, and so forth. When potentially useful data are discovered from another lab, it is simple to request the PI for access.
		</td>
		<td width="12%"><img src="img/features/db_search.png" width="80%" ></td>
	</tr>
		
	
	<tr> <!-- Quality Assurance-->
		<td vertical-align="middle"> 
			<strongg>Quality Assurance - </strongg> </br>Data entered into SDM are routinely analyzed to identify instrument and data quality. These are run in the background, without user intervention. The results are summarized both for the MRI Center staff and for the users.
		</td>
		<td width="12%"><img src="img/features/db_quality.png" width="80%" ></td>
	</tr>
			
	
	<tr> <!-- Transparency -->
		<td vertical-align="middle"> 
			<strongg>Transparency - </strongg> </br>SciTran is open-source software, released under the MIT license. Our code is hosted on <a href="http://github.com/scitran/">GitHub</a>. You can also access our technical documentation on our GitHub Site.
